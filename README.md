# Readme

Welcome! This is the GitHub repo for Thought Lounge's new Squarespace site. Currently it is being hosted at m1tlwebdev.squarespace.com, and will soon be hosted at thoughtlounge.org. TL uses a meteor.js app which is currently in production for the signup/user functionality. It will be hosted soon at doatl.thoughtlounge.org. 

## Workflow
The workflow is as follows: We have 1 main developer who SFTP's new live code from Sublime Text to the SS site. Whenever there have been enough changes made to make it worth his while to get it saved, he replaces his code in his local thoughtloungeSS repo folder with a copy of his current code. He then pushes up to axelzcramer/thoughtloungeSS and voila! He is saving code without having to store a billion commits on his computer.

## So What is Thought Lounge?
Thought Lounge is a nonprofit organization consisting of initiatives aimed at fostering true dialogue. TL utilizes Lean Startup Methodologies to learn with communities what true dialogue is, create innovative settings that provide it, and make communities aware of the opportunity to participate in such settings. Although originally formed to enhance the college campus experience, TL has since demonstrated its potential to impact almost any community, whether that be universities, companies, senior centers, or national governments.
